## Description

This project was created to generate dynamically a team profile with user input. For this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.

Whem the user run the application, a prompt will be log to write the Manager information of the team, then the user will be able to choose between Engineer and Intern.
After the user has ended adding employees, an HTML file will be created.
